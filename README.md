# Brain-Tumor-Classification
Brain Tumor MRI Classification is an end‑to‑end deep learning project that trains multiple models (ResNet50, VGG16, a custom CNN, SVM, and Random Forest) to automatically detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor.
